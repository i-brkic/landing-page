Project: Landing Page

Project in which I tried to use the basics of Flexbox as efficiently as I can. Though by no means perfect, my main goals was to allign items on the page
as displayed in the project_goal folder. In the end, I achieved the result and in the process used my understanding of concepts such as: main and cross axis, justify content and align items, flex grow/shrink etc. The result is not responsive, but it looks good on my personal machine of choice.
